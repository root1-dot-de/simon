First brainstorming ...

1) Client send to "who's out there" message to multicast address
2) Server sends response back to asking client. Message contains:

"[hostname:port|remoteobjectname_1,remoteobjectname_2,...,remoteobjectname_n]"

Things to decide:

1) What about number of users connected with remote objects?
2) Security? Allow/Disallow showing number of users?
3) What about 
	1) asking for servers
	2) query server for more details, i.e. number of users (also statistics? -> security?)
4) What other details are interesting?
